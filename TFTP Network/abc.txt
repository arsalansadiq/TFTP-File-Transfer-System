Teams will design and implement a file transfer system based on the TFTP specification (RFC 1350) that is
available on the course website and that has been discussed in class. The system will consist of TFTP client(s)
running on one or several computers, an error simulator, and a multithreaded TFTP server that runs on a
different computer. The code will be written in Java, using the Eclipse IDE. You must design your code to
work in the lab environment provided!\



Note that there will be three  programs: the client(s), the server, and the error simulator(s). Each
program will run as a separate Win-32 process, and the programs will communicate via DatagramSocket
objects. In “normal” mode, only the client and server programs will run. In “test” mode, all three programs will
be used.



You must be able to run multiple main programs (projects) concurrently. See the Reference Material on
the course web site for hints in doing this in Eclipse.
Your team's code must demonstrate good prmminyle, and be well documented. For examples of
“industrial quality” Java code, have a look at Sun's Java coding conventions, which can be found on the Oracle
Web site.



All team members should be familiar with all aspects of the code and diagrams for your group. Working in (at
least) pairs for the programming, debugging, and developing the diagrams is recommended. If any team
members are not pulling their weight, please notify the TAs and/or instructor as early in the term as possible
